# SimpleSpringApp

In this project I'm making my first tests using Spring framework.

In the *test1* I'm making use of Spring and Spring initializr to create an app that just sends a message to a web port, which is by default in Spring the 8080.

In the *test2* I'm making use of Spring and JUnit. With JUnit, I'm testing a message using *assertEquals* to compare the content.
